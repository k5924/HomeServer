# HomeServer

## Introduction

> This repository hosts the docker compose files for the home server I created during quarantine in 2020. The services I am running are on a Raspberry Pi 4 2GB model.<br> I am also running Pihole, Adminer, Watchtower and DDclient as individual containers on the server but these werent made with a docker compose file.

## Installation

> The code can be installed using Portainer or by running the docker.yaml file. I installed Poratiner by first installing OpenMediaVault then installing Docker and Portainer through OpenMediaVault.
